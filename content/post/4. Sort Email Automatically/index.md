## Just start using filters

Do you get a pit in your stomach when you are about to open your email inbox? Well, here is #OneGoodIdea: start using filters for your incoming emails.

- You don't want to see that email anymore? 
Create a filter so all the current one and future emails incoming from that source gets automatically deleted without hitting your inbox.
- Your receive an invoice from **xyz** every month and you don't want to sort it manually every time?
Create a filter for it to skip your inbox in the future and be sorted into your invoice label or folder. (or forward it to your bookkeeper automatically)
- You have a separate business or commitment that sends a lot of emails?
Create a filter that tags it automatically, let it hit your inbox, and archive it once it's read.

Here is a video that shows you how to do that using Gmail.
